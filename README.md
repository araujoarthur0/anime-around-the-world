Interactive open-source community built map showing how your favorite anime is spread around the world.

# Description
Ever wanted to see how all the different animes you like are spread around the world? Now you can :)
This is an interactive github-hosted map that allows you to spin the earth and find animes taking place anywhere you imagine. And, it's open source! If you find something is wrong, or your favorite anime is missing, feel free to add a pull request with the changes.

Original idea came from this amazing map posted on Reddit by /u/FetchFrosh/: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/i7qzr6/anime_set_outside_of_japan_a_map_of_70_anime.
Just wanted to expand on it.
